# Lab 4 completed:

## What needed doing:

- Many compile-time bugs and incompatibilities across sheets needed fixing - bit mismatches across sheets, misspelled variable names etc;
- Logical errors needed fixing - Typos in case-switches copied from lecture slide tables, incorrect concatenations etc;
- Implemented BNE;
- Implemented I-type instructions;
- Fixed instruction register, making it byte addressed, not word addressed, and an issue with it being too large;
