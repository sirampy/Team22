# RISC-V simple single-cycle implementation:

## What is this?

This is a single cycle implementation of a RISC-V CPU according to the instructions provided in lectures. All instructions shown in lectures have been implemented (see lecture 6 for full tables). This comes with a testbench which tests every available instruction, and produces an expected waveform (IMAGE????), which can then be used to compare against our other branches to verify they work.

The full test code is in `rtl/top.tb`
